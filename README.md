Game of Life (My Programming Fundamentals' final Project) 

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

It only works in linux terminal for now because of system functions and will be updated soon.
